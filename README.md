# div-entry-test
Dark-themed project container, username/password form, and a toggle between light/dark modes using moon and sun icons.
This is a test webpage that demonstrates many features and components. It is made up of a project container with a stylish dark theme, as well as a background color and box shadow. The container holds project material, such as a logo and a form where users can input their username and password. The form includes input fields and icons to create a visually pleasing user experience. The website also uses responsive design, which adapts its layout to different screen widths. The moon and sun icons act as toggles to transition between light and dark modes, affecting the colors and styles of the elements. The toggle feature is handled by the JavaScript code, which also listens for form submissions. Overall, this project exhibits the use of design components, icons, responsive layout, and interactivity in the context of web development.
